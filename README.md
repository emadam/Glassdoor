This is a personal effort where I researched "Data Analyst" job openings in Melbourne. As a result, this project shows minimum and maximum salary of a Data Analyst in Melbourne, Australia according to job advertisements gathered from https://www.glassdoor.com.au/ and saves the results in a PostgreSQL database in order to have historical data for further analysis.
